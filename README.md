2. open all files with Pycharm or other code editor.
3. Run the `main.py` script, get results output according to prompt input.
4. Run `UIVersion` to display the UI.
5. **Customization Options:** According to the format of the `stations.txt` file, replace it with your own file and you can get your own shortest path finding system, when running `UIVersion`, font, font colour, and background picture and be replaced.
