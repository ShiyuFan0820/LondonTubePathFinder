# LondonTubePathFinder

The goal of this project is to build a station-to-station pathfinding system for London tube.

TODO List:

**Before the code**
1. Search and download the data of stations of each tube in London.
2. Read the data file. The original data in `.mat` format and the method to read the data can be found at:

- [Data in .mat format.](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~arb/data/spatial-underground-London/)

- [How to read the .mat file in Python.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/874461/read-mat-files-in-python)

- [Organized data in txt file.](https://github.com/mincongzhang/StationPathFinder/blob/master/LondonTube/LondonTube/stations.txt)

**Write the code**
1. Read the `.mat` data file, extract the content and convert in to a `.txt` file.
